# Cursor AI Rules for School Platform Project

## MANDATORY: Read Project Info First
Before starting ANY work on this project, you MUST read and understand:
- `project_info.json` - Complete project structure, all modules, features, and specifications
- `AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Detailed guidelines and protocols

## Project Overview
This is a comprehensive school management platform with two main systems:
1. **School Platform** (`school-platform/`) - Web application (Vanilla JS + Firebase)
2. **Anaplirosis** (`anaplirosis/`) - React application for schedule/substitution management

**Total**: 27 major modules, 150+ features, 7 user roles

## Auto-Update Protocol
When you make ANY changes:
1. Update `project_info.json` immediately
2. Update `last_updated` timestamp
3. Add change notes in `important_notes.latest_changes`

## Key Files to Always Check
- `project_info.json` - Project structure and features (READ FIRST)
- `js/utils/constants.js` - User roles and permissions
- `js/services/*.js` - Backend services
- `js/pages/*.js` - Page components

## Architecture Rules
- School Platform: Vanilla JS, modular services, Firebase backend
- Anaplirosis: React 18, component-based, hooks for state
- Always check permissions before operations
- Always cleanup Firebase listeners
- Follow existing code patterns

## When Starting Work
1. Read `project_info.json` completely
2. Understand which module you're working on
3. Check related files in `js/services/` and `js/pages/`
4. Verify permissions needed

## When Finishing Work
1. Update `project_info.json` with changes
2. Update `last_updated` field
3. Document what was changed
4. Ensure all listeners are cleaned up
